# Working With Others

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

Pairing Lecture Notes:

1. What is pairing:

   - Two people (does not mean it needs to be 2 developers... just 2 people on one task [programming, emails, design, etc])
   - Two keyboards / two mice (if both people don't have control, then your just watching 1 person work, doing a "shoulder hover")
   - ONE computer / ONE task

2. What is NOT pairing

   - Multiple on a zoom hanging out
   - Two people in a zoom working on separate things (this is just hanging out)
   - 3-4 people trying to fix a bug together

3. Why pair?

   - 2 sets of eyes
   - Scientific study proving that the perception of progress increases, work in more enjoyable, and rate of bugs/errors is statistically lowered
   - Improved problem solving because of the different backgrounds, knowledge, and perspectives of the two people.
   - Faster learning because verbalizing the concept/problem helps you learn and understand better (you learn best by teaching).

4. Getting started

   - Two roles
   - Driver: the focus on syntax, typing, pixels, they are focused on the single/narrow current tax
   - Navigator: to focus on the wider scale/overall design of the code instead of the single line/component. They also help debug and work with the driver when the driver has an issue
   - It should be very clear who is the driver and who is the navigator
   - The "low skill" person should drive (we want them to learn more and be more hands on)
   - The "higher skill" person should navigate (their higher skill level makes taking an "overview" standpoint more easy/make more since)
   - If you do it the opposite the low skill person will not be able to keep up.
   - It's best to figure out who should drive and who should navigate by both people being honest and explaining their background with directness (Hey we're working on auth, have you ever touched Auth0? "yeah just a bit" ok great i've never touched it so I'll drive and can you help navigate? "sounds good!")

5. Work till you need a break (or 45 mins pass) (go with the pomodoro technique)

6. Take a break!

7. Swap roles (high skill, low skill is for who should start, but if one person wants to drive for 2 rounds.. thats ok, just not the entire time)

8. Jump back to 1

- Take breaks!! often!!! more than you think you need!! pairing is mentally taxing. you'll need it

- Silence is bad (the first time you do this, it's common, but it's wrong. So the easiest thing to do to combat this is to take a break and swap roles).

- Pairing is a learned skill, you learn by doing! you are expected to do this daily.
