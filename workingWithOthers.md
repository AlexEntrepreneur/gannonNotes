# Pair programing

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

1.  Our goal is to build happy and productive team that have great communication skills.

- Good communication kills merge conflicts, increasing productivity and lowering stress
- Avoids wasted engineering hours by having multiple people working on the same thing or same file at the same time.

2.  On effective teams

- Everyone feels valued

  - imposter syndrome: keep it in mind, everyone (even people with 15+ years of industry experience) feel it. It's normal. acknowledge the feeling and then acknowledge your skills and abilities and know you will be ok and will succeed.
    -humility (have a proper (not downplayed, not prideful) of your own skills. Know and acknowledge your skills, and seek out advice and help from people where you recognize you are not as strong. Be willing to help others in the ways you are stronger in.
  - Acknowledge that everyone brings value, often in different ways. If you think a teammate isn't bringing value, it's most likely because you don't know how they are bringing their value. Talk and to get to know them and ask to pair program on their tasks to learn about what they do. It's easy for these feeling to occur when working on teams that not everyone understands everyone elses role. You can't measure the way you bring value to same way someone brings value.
  - Practice gratitude: give positive shout-outs in meetings, leave positive comments in code reviews, and offer compliments while paring.

- We work through conflict

- We work cross functionally
  - Understand that we speak different languages. So a word like "feature" might mean one thing to a UX designer and different thing to a Full Stack Developer and another different thing to a data scientist. **Example**: FSW "a discrete user action"; DS "a feature is an element of a prediction model that impacts the overall output"; UX "a value-add for the customer"
    -So when you're communicating take the extra time to really define and explain what exactly you're saying and trying to describe to people from different backgrounds and tracks.
    -know that generalizations can be helpful but also can be considered harmful. So frame your assumptions (generalizations) as a question, instead of a fact. "I was under the impression that UX designers did this type of coding, was the correct?"
    -understand that different roles have different focus
    Engineer: Implement/Solutions
    Designer: Research/Usability
    DAScientist: Experiment/Learn
