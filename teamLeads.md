# Pair programing

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

1. Meetings can suck, but don't have to.

2. Share understanding of goals

- "_Whats most important today_"
- The answer to this question can shift over the course of the day. The standup can help keep the team focused on what is most important for the day.

3. Coordinate efforts (know who is doing what)

- Make sure the tasks of the day are assigned to someone and following up with them
- Assign people to pair up against tasks, pair programming is great

4. Share problems and improvements

- Hard to systematize this because it's not a consistent thing.
- Keep an eye out for "learning opportunities" to tell to the team and give team member an opportunity to express problems and solutions they experienced.

5. Team identity

- Is developed more "face to face" over video calls than over just text like Slack.

6. Team Leads are responsible for momentum (writing code, helping with planning, sitting with a student who is stuck and helping them with technical and/or personal problems) and visibility to the SL's, Managers, and Stake holders. You are the go-to person so we can best understand how the team is doing. You need to be able to summarize how the team is presently and over the past 24 hours.

7. TL's are not responsible for escalations or getting people in trouble. The SL's and managers will handle the "bad guy" stuff. You don't worry about discipline styled things, because you are not a manager, you are a leader. a "first among equals"

8. Keep it short. (15ish mins) part of keeping momentum is not letting the meeting getting derailed. Control the standup and don't let it hijacked with random rabbit holes (like daughters paintings and stuff) so use your wisdom to know when an "aside" is appropriate but tactfully cutting it off if it's not productive. you are the "time cop" use your judgement.

9. Walk the board:

- Talk through every single thing that is not done, but is started, and to see where that thing is in terms of progress.

- Start on the right most side, open each card up, and ask "what does it mean to get this card completely done"
- Make the status report about the things that need to be done, not about the persons/individuals.
- Reminds student that the focus is on getting things done so we can launch the product, not on individual accomplishments (team focused at all times, not individual focused).
- If a card is done... move it to the done column, if it's not done, assign someone to finish it and literally put their name on it.
- Make use of the notes/comments functionality of trello and take live notes during the standup for anything discussed about the open card.
- _Your team mates won't take Trello seriously if YOU don't take it seriously._
- Once the "doing" column is done... go to what needs doing and walk through that too.
- When you open a card, ask the person that's already on/assigned to that card how it's going. If a card doesn't have someone assigned... assign it.

10. Mix it up. Don't let your stand ups go stale and become crappy.

11. Pro-tip:

- Set reminders in slack 15 min prior to standup with a link to the standup form that pings the channel for student to fillout, so you have time to review them before the standup.
- Link: https://airtable.com/shr21XOcbcSiAGrd8

- Build a private channel for you team and use the github app to ping that channel when a PR needs to be reviewed, etc.
