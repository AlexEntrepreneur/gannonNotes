# Labs Intro

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

1. This is team wide and team focused. Not your 1 on 1.

   Retrospectives are a backward-facing meeting that is focused on learning from a certain time frame (a 2-week sprint in this case) think of it like "Group Consoling" where you can hash everything that's happened in the last 2 weeks and how that can be improved.

2. Use the check in form that Jess provided as a template:

   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6Uihd7--7IEgY89qbAG8Zhuv0wcpmLncmisqnGDlaU/edit#heading=h.kn9f96h25lh7](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C6Uihd7--7IEgY89qbAG8Zhuv0wcpmLncmisqnGDlaU/edit#heading=h.kn9f96h25lh7)

- Reference/read the Prime Directive at the start

- Handle the check in by having the participants put in their name and 1 word on how participants are feeling.

- The facilitator will fill in the Four Quadrants section:

- In the What Went Well and What Went Poorly section: be specific. Mention people or programs or lectures that helped a lot so that feedback can influence what works and thus should stay/continue to be done in Labs or removed. (this is not a place to say "James drop the ball and sucks because his React skills are trash" this is the place for "this aspect of our project went poorly, this is the thing (authentication, merge conflict, miscommunication, some frontend component) and this is the reason why it went wrong (need to study docs more, need to debug more, need use Trello more for better communication to avoid merge conflicts")

- In the appreciations section: When you mention an appreciation mention a person's name and what they did. avoid "I appreciate the team because the team is great" or "I appreciate Johnny because he's awesome" look for more specific things.

- In the Ideas Section: Proposals for how things can can be improved.

- Action items: for things that are fixable, list them and assign at least 1 person to own fixing it (and you'll review/reference this in the next Retrospective)

- Example: if there is a trello issue, assign someone or a team of people to do "Trello Audits"

- Example: This library or thing is being difficult to use @Johnny is going to look into and possible replacement API options.

## Retro on Retro

We will rate the Process and the outcomes of this retro

- Make sure the team enters them at the same time. This avoids team members being influenced by other team members scores. "ok everyone cursers on screen and in 1...2...3 go!"

- Process: were we on time, was it civil or chaotic, etc

- Outcomes: did something actually come out of the meeting? Do we feel we have a real game plan on how to change/improve the next 2+ weeks.

- Drill into people that 5 is "as expected" kill the high school view that 7 = passing. That will skew the data.

- Make notes on the outlier scores (the 10's the sub 5's) and write down why those scores are there.
