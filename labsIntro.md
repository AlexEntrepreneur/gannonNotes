# Labs Intro

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

1. Labs is to simulate a real world working environment with you on a world-class product development team building a awesome app or building on an amazing app. You will be expected to act and behave during labs the same way you would act and behave at a real company.

2. Spend MORE time planning than coding (focus on communication, live and die on trello and slack more than anything else). You can plan for 10 minutes or debug for 10 hours... the choice is yours.

3. This is not 8 weeks of capstone project time. This about real world styled Product Cycles. (research, discover, build/code, repeat). Your code will be shipped with analytics and be used by real customers.

   - explore problem
   - design solutions
   - ship features
   - measure impact

4. You will succeed as a team or fail as team. Just like real life. Therefore the rockstar individuals are those that help the team reach their goal together and not the person that just codes really well. You are trying to be product creators and team members first... coders second. Working hard isn't how you measure success. Results/Delivery are.

How to measure your work:

- Quality delivery
- Strategic alignment
- Contribution and collaboration
- Problem solving

5. **The airtables are important!** Take the sprint retros very seriously and take the deadlines for them very seriously. People who fail to do this stuff in a professional environment can get fired. We take it seriously too.

6. The goal is to have multiple successful feature releases.

7. Team Lead Info:
   Your TL is part of the team. They are not "above" the team, they are just a "first among equals" that is the liaison between the team and the SL's/Labs Staff. They are there to help, mentor, and motivate the team to achieve the end goal.

8. Office hours are available to help you in whatever way you need.
