# Communicating With yYour Stakeholder

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

Communicating with stakeholders lecture notes:

1. Don't be as concerned about getting all the features from a long list of MVP features done, MVP is dead. You are being evaluated on executing on product cycles.... so make following through on that your key priority.
2. Traditional Process (the Root Causes of failed products: the thing you DON"T want to do)

- ideas
- biz case
- road map
- requirements
- design
- build
- test
- deploy

3. Product Cycle (the RIGHT way to do things)

- Explore Problem
- Design Solutions
- Ship Features
- Measure Impact

4. Stakeholder expectations

   Take into account of what the stakeholder needs, and bringing that in with your own input on whats possible with the current scope. This is like the real world... there are priorities to weighed and decided upon. If they ask for the world... bring them tactfully into reality and set up a path to ultimately getting what they want. Failure is natural and will happen, but you will never END in failure. only grow from them.

   If your stakeholder is not responding, contact Jessica Wilkinson.

- If they don't make it to your daily standups... that's fine, but be able to keep them updated via the daily email to the stakeholder.
- They are required to attend your Product Cycle Planning meetings.
- You can invite stakeholder to your slack channel (and/or join their slack channel if the stakeholder requests it). Be professional, but still human.
- Make sure the staging server links are in the Product Vision Doc so the stakeholder can access it
- Invite them to your trello board so they can address the cards in the Stakeholder review section (this another reason why you need to make sure your teams live and die on trello... it's super important).
- If your asked to use the github org of a partner... thats fine, you can transfer things. But make sure it's still publicly available (hit up Edd or Hamza if there are questions around this).

Expect there to be lag due to the natural bottle neck of having a stakeholder. HOWEVER do not let it kill your MOMENTUM (one of your two key responsibilities as a TL) find something to do, and bring VISIBILITY (the other responsibility) to your SL and labs managers so we can help out as much as possible. There is always something to do (might not be fun or sexy all the time, but we need to get work done so do it when you're blocked).

**Be RESPECTFUL** to your stakeholder (don't talk unfavorably in slack, no back-channel chatter). They are not engineers and they are learning new things just like you are. YOU are expected to model this behavior and kill any such behavior if you see it coming from a team member. These stakeholders are helping us by donating their time and giving you a great opportunity. Don't screw it up, even when they say stuff that might seem dumb or odd. Practice EMPATHY and be polite/tactful this is a hyper-important real life skill.

- Team leads are expected to handle communications/connections with stake holders (for the INITIAL communications, CC and go with Brent and Jessica Wilkinsons)
- TL's will be expected to send Standup Note Emails(or slack if they prefer it or are an internal stakeholder) to stakeholders daily (template inbound)
- **MVP DOES NOT EXIST NOW.** The goal is to have 2 complete product cycles. Knocking out Product cycles is your goal above all (a Product cycle is release of a cluster of features a more detailed lesson will be done on friday).
- PVD is not suppose to be concerned with scope per say, let the stakeholder feel heard! even if it's a ton of features and things. We focus on scope with Feature Docs and deciding which of the many features should be in a certain product cycle.
