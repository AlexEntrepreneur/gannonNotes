# HR and You

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

1. HR helps manage people and culture at a company to make employee experience better and happier. Lambda Lab's HR is Student Success (SS)

2. SS is here to help you get through lambda and get a job.

3. Conduct: Be Dependable (for work and attendance especially), Be Respectful, OVER communicate with team members. (your conduct affects your ability to pass Labs, it's serious).

4. Have your camera on unless you have a good reason for having it off, mention that reason to your TL/team members prior that it's off for a reason, out of respect for them.

5. Attendance: you can miss 8 hours per month. If you have something come up (illness, problem, event, etc) let your TL know ahead of time. There is no excuse for going Missing in Action and you can be withdrawn for doing so (No-call no-show is a common reason for getting fired in the real world too). So just talk about it ahead of time and we'll be good :slightly_smiling_face:

6. Success plan: Lambda does not want to just cut you out. We know things happen and we will do our best to create success plans to get you back on track and see you be successful. Student Success is here to see YOU become Successful! We can't be understanding if you don't communicate though. So help us to help you.

7. Reminder: the paperwork MATTERS. A lot!
