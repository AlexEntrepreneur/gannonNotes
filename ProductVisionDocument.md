# Product Vision Document

### Notes by Gannon Darcy

2. The Product Vision Doc is to drive the product vision at a high level. The components/layout is done for you

3. Feature Canvas is different:
   -Product vision doc is meant to exist through teams/product cycles. While the feature canvas is for single features. So a Product canvas doc has (ideally) several Feature Canvas's.

4. See the Notion document for the details of each individual section, they have already been heavily noted and explained.

5. Keep objectives succinct.

6. Each feature can be broad (they will be more broken down in the Feature Canvas for said feature). But be careful to control "feature creep"

7. Each team member needs to be able to understand and verbally explain this document. (even if you are not presenting it, you need to understand all of it and know it well), and be able to defend your choices to a degree too. (this is something you'll want to do because hiring managers in job interviews are going to ask you to talk about projects like this: So know your overview, your tech stack, why you picked that tech stack and/or why you didn't pick a different tech, be able to give a reasonable answer to why you picked something, not "idk... its the only thing I know" etc)

8. Each time will need to present and get final sign-off by Jess or Holdy.

9. "Spiking" aka exploration of a technology. You might not be sure if a certain tech piece is right or not, so you can explore it and then depending on how that process went, defend the choice (example: Edd's team when they started with MongoDB and switched to Postgres). Don't be stressed if you picked a tech stack and then need to pivot later. (Just don't wait too long to make the pivot, and don't second guess yourself too much). When in doubt, ping your engineering manager (Jess or Holdy)

10. Don't pick a technology just because it's cool or "in" this is NOT the time to roll that dice. Use what is necessary first and comfortable second... fancy or neat is a dead last reason for picking something.

11. Every project will have a stack holder (an external company/non-profit that needs help or an internal stake holder like Joshua Howland ) The stake holder's word is gospel. They are the final word on anything and everything. So learn how to communicate with them and translate what they say into your finished product (and Product Vision Doc, etc).

Pro-tip: everyone take notes during these meetings, the last thing you want to do is forget something they say and fail to execute on it and they notice in the next meeting.

12. Focus first on the high-level vision, the user journey, and the problems you want to tackle and competition you're going up against. Then get into the technical decisions after and base those decisions on the answers from the first line of questions.
